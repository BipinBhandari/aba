# aba

aba is scaffolding CLI tool to generate almost everything written on JS. Main goal of aba is to reduce time wasted on creating directories and files and writing similar code (such as creating react component, importing react on every jsx file) during programming. Overall it aims to improve programmer's productivity by decreasing time taken to do repetitive tasks. 

Currently at very early stage (testing on my projects)
